# Script for installing StarUML for Fedora

This script was tested on Fedora 22. It downloads the version 2.60 of StarUML from its webpage. In case they update their version, please indicate it to me to test a new installation script (or maybe only change its version, hopefully).

NOTE: Only use the uninstall script if you used the installation script here (or if the instructions you've used for installation are similar to the installation script). I can't assure it will work fully if not done that way. Besides, it has been only tested on 64-bit systems. I still need to check how to download the 32-bit version.

Thanks to Vijaya Simha Reddy Aedavelli, because of the libudev linking detail. The instructions where this script was based on are located at https://staruml.uservoice.com/forums/245359-feature-request/suggestions/7102764-rmp-packages-for-fedora.
